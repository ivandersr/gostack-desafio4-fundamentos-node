# GoStack Challenge 4 - Back-end in Node.js

This application was created with Typescritp in Node.js to store financial transactions, allowing them to be registered, listing and calculating the overall balance.
To register a transaction, the user must inform a short description as title, its value and the information if it is an income or outcome.
Negative balances are not allowed, so an outcome transaction should not exceed the balance.


To run this application, clone this repository and execute "yarn" command to install all dependencies.
